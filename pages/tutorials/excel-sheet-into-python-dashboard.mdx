# Turn excel sheet into Python dashboard

We created a simple Python dashboard using data from an Excel sheet and `pandas`, `mercury` and `altair` packages. 
In this article you will learn:

- how to load excel sheets to your Jupyter Notebook,
- how to use Markdown, NumberBox, Range and Table `mercury` widgets,
- how to create charts using `vega-altair`,
- how to turn your notebook into Web App.


## Import required packages

You will need following packages: 

```python
pandas 
mercury
altair
```

- `pandas`  is  for data manipulation and analysis.
- `mercury` will be used for interactive widgets and for running notebook as a web app.
- `altair` for creating declarative statistical visualizations.

Make sure that you have installed them before start doing anything.

The cell code with imports :

```python
import pandas as pd 
import mercury as mr 
import altair as alt
```

## Get Data 

In this case, we used an example excel sheet:

<Screenshot src={excelSheet} alt="Example excel sheet." />

You need to load the data from an Excel file into a DataFrame. This will allow to manipulate and analyze the data easily.

```python 
df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx')
```

## Create Dashboard

### Set heading 
Please set a heading for the dashboard using the [**Markdown**](/docs/output-widgets/markdown/) widget:

```python
mr.Markdown(text="# **Employee Hours Log**")
```

### Create boxes with numbers

To provide a quick overview of the **Salary** and **Wage** data, please create two sets of [**NumbeBox**](/docs/output-widgets/numberbox/) widgets. The first set will show the lowest, highest, and average salaries, and the second set will show the same statistics for wages:

```python 
mr.NumberBox([
    mr.NumberBox(data=f"{df['Salary'].min()}$", title="Lowest salary"),
    mr.NumberBox(data=f"{df['Salary'].max()}$", title="Highest salary"),
    mr.NumberBox(data=f"{round(df['Salary'].mean())}$", title="Average salary")
])
```

```python 
mr.NumberBox([
    mr.NumberBox(data=f"{df['Wage'].min()}$", title="Lowest wage"),
    mr.NumberBox(data=f"{df['Wage'].max()}$", title="Highest wage"),
    mr.NumberBox(data=f"{round(df['Wage'].mean())}$", title="Average wage")
])
```

### Add interactive widget

To allow users to filter the data based on age range, you need to include an interactive [**Range**](/docs/input-widgets/range/) widget. This will let users select an age range and dynamically update the visualizations based on their selection.

```python 
range = mr.Range(value=[18, 30], min=18, max=30, label="Choose age range", step=1)
```

### Create Chart 

Please create a chart which shows age dependence on payments. You will need `altair` package: 
 
Now, please create a chart to show the relationship between age and wage. You can use `altair` package:

```python
alt.Chart(df).mark_point(
    filled=True,
    size=100,
    color='red'
).encode(
    x=alt.X('Age', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[range.value[0],range.value[1]])),  
    y=alt.Y('Wage', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[df['Wage'].min()-1,df['Wage'].max()+1])),
    tooltip=['Age','Wage']
).interactive().properties(
    width='container'
)
```

If something is unclear, check [**Altair Docs**](https://altair-viz.github.io/).

### Create Table 

Then, please create a table to display the entire dataset. You can use [**Table**](/docs/output-widgets/table/) widget: 

```python
mr.Table(df, width='200px')
```

## Create a Web App

Deploying Web App is very easy that you can do it in 3 steps:

<div className="steps-container">

### Login to Mercury Cloud

If you don't have account, you can create it here: [**Mercury Cloud**](https://cloud.runmercury.com/register).

### Create new site

Create new or use an existing site. 

### Upload your notebook

Upload the notebook with code.

</div>

**Congrats!** You just created your own Web App and you can share your Jupyter Notebooks with nontechnical users. If you need more information about deploying the Web App check [**Mercury Cloud Documentation**](https://runmercury.com/docs/cloud/).

## Final Effect 

Here is a teaser of Web App:
